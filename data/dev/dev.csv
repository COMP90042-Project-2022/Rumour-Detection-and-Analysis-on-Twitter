Can new audio help the Michael Brown investigation? Listen to what an attorney says could be key to the investigation http://t.co/HACEykYCVZ
@CNN it's always an excuse for killing unarmed people. Cops stick together. Period.
@CNN s/b verifiable but #haters, deniers &amp; #racists will find a way to diiscount it. dude better leave town/stay hidden
@CNN no, that audio won't help with anything.
@CNN why is audio a game changer? Shots in car, pause as he exited, more shots! Nothing new!
If it's anything like your unverified anonymous source who said Wilson didn't have a fractured eye socket no. No it isn't real. @CNN
@CNN No. Let me know if you have any other questions for me.
@CNN  do wanna help the investigation or your ratings? Cnn put up that Michael Brown video. Did that help or hurt? #ferguson
@CNN maybe there will be more rioting so the blacks can completely wipe ferguson off the map, burn the city down that will make them smile
@sportbikeguy00 @CNN yes a brotherhood that kills an average of 400 people yearly and is responsible for almost 6,000 deaths since 9/11
@CNN @SuzyQ How could Micheal Brown assault an armed officer if he was NOT armed with just his bare hands?
@CNN Always bare in mind,cops will always protect other cops,it's a brotherhood wether anyone wants to acknowledge it or not
@CNN how come all we gear about is the black person shit by a white cop. But not the white kid shot by a black cop. Happened same time
@CNN A person hears gunshots and doesn't pause speaking? A person doesn't hear the gunshots at first but does later (much later)? Hard sell.

@CNN with how far advanced our technology is a audio recording could easily be faked/tampered. Only thing you can bank on is hard evidence.
@CNN are you going to cover the nationwide rally for officer wilson.
@CNN NO!!can you see Brown charging the Officer so Don Lemons reporting yesterday was irresponsible and down right dumb. One sided reporting
@CNN THE MORE YOU STIR THE WORSE IT STINKS!!1
@CNN Who cares! Enough already of this Michael Brown case. The kid gets more attention than our servicemen overseas in a frigin war!

@Lrihendry @gurugone Can't pray or practice Christianity,  but can do this! What the Hell?!
@Lrihendry A lot of controversy about this website. Some petition to shut it down.
@Lrihendry AND WHT  R THE PARENTS OF THOSE STUDENTS DOING ??????????????????????
@Lrihendry  Just another reason to shut down public schools.

@Lrihendry @NancyCLTUSA Parents need to throw that school up for grabs.
.@Lrihendry If ever there was a need to take a stand, this is it. I'm convinced they're indoctrinating children to worship an anti-Christ..
@Lrihendry @lovusa4 It appears to only be State sponsored religion if they are made to recite Christian prayers.
@Lrihendry @ChristieC733 What would happen if muslims were forced to pray as Christians, attend Catholic Mass, communion???????
@Lrihendry @CorlessJones no way

@michellemalkin gotta make it hurt as much as possible. If a few kids disappear Harry and the Dems can really push the blame knife deep

"@CNN
Vatican says #KimDavis' meeting w/ #PopeFrancis 'should not be considered a form of support.' http://t.co/Ws0NMBY0cN http://t.co/JuKpcg0KDb
@CNN #surelookslikeit
@CNN her supporters had the contacts with papal hierarchy to get this set up - those supporters keeping it in the news
@CNN I'll believe that when #PopeFrancis meets with leaders of the #lgbt community The #Pope sent a clear message by meeting with #KimDavis
@CNN why are either of these idiots getting any coverage
@CNN why the hell not
@HenryMgonzales It is perplexing, read an article yesterday, that said Pope was unaware, something to do with vatican politics. @CNN
@CNN I dont understand all this nut hugging for the pope anyway. He is a sham and a douche... same as all of them.
@CNN Not what she is claiming
@C_keroftruth101 takes a lot of courage to continue being a bigot whilst your country is trying not to be
@CNN Kim Davis makes my skin crawl!
@CNN ask POTUS why does Chicago his home town has very strict gun laws &amp; very high gun violence? @GMA @MSNBC @CBSNews @NewDay @NBCNews
@hndavis12 @CNN 1 of the great things about this pope is he doesn't care about appearances. Maybe he was modeling peace &amp; forgiveness
@CNN thank GOD
@CNN Well, she's a very lucky person to have met him.
@CNN Of course it's a form of support! It just shouldn't have any impact on our political policies.  He supported the death row inmate too
@Lindzsy @CNN she got elected in local election when her mom retired from the position. its a small town so go figure #KanyeShrug
@CNN hope he gave her a WTF about being divorced 3 times.
@CNN Many people ""meet"" with a Pope. Apparently this was a blessing in DC. He probably never heard of her then Wham! He's in a storm.
@CNN all of a sudden the memorable visit left a bad taste in my mouth
@CNN @TheDeemeister too late! What other reason would the Pope have for a private meeting (she's not even Catholic)
@CNN The face of mental illness being made famous.
@CNN @CodyDorumsgaard ((saw your status on Facebook the other day))
@CNN  yes just like people do for imagrents.
@CNN then what should it be considered? Unless he performed an exorcism on that witch, it will be considered support. #getreal
@CNN A church desperate to look cool is a sad thing
@CNN She just needs to go away
@CNN #KimDavis should have kept this meeting private bet that's what Pope wanted shes using it to glorify/publicize herself more #Shameless
@CNN The Vatican is has given in. SMH. #KimDavis has More guts and stronger in her faith Than the Vatican and it Pope.
@CNN #PopeFrancis is a bullshitter
@CNN What is it then? Does Catholic church support homosexuality? Does it conduct gay marriages?
@CNN So what was it then? Trying to help the sinner stop homophobing? A strategy session? Swapping culture war stories? An affair?
@CNN don't tell me that the Vatican us telling a lie
@CNN it's definitely support. But the Pope is also someone who has done nothing to stop clergy abuse. So who really cares.
@CNN Then exactly how should the meeting be considered? @Pontifex shouldn't have met with #KimDavis to begin with. Rewarded bad behavior.
@CNN @BjdelongBj.  Nor forgiveness...
@CNN So what is it? With God there is no sitting on the wall
@CNN With that meeting, the Pope sadly undid a great deal of what his visit was.
@CNN https://t.co/Q5tM17kho6 buy this album if you love the pope
@BevDiane @southern_bel Terrible to follow Catholic doctrine by a pope, seriously ?
@southern_bel @hndavis12 @CNN If he doesn't care about appearances, why spin the visit? It was ill conceived and looked terrible for Pope.
@CNN Who ya gonna believe - me or the pope? They lyin! #gaykentucky #refreekimdavis
@CNN Most assuredly not! Ms. Davis has a true commitment to God and His Word. The Pope has a true commitment to his lavish lifestyle and $$.
@CNN Too late for this...
@CNN  I stand with you Kim..God be with you.
@CNN ~ did he spank her ?
@CNN so if all the military and police who protected him on his US  visit refused to do their job  based on religious beliefs is that ok?
@CNN you support or you don't, sorry, too many on the fence, it broke.
With how many of God's gay children did @Pontifex meet? In secret or public? Whether supportive or not? @CNN
@CNN the things we make news worthy just baffle ones mind, find a solution to Oregon like issues
@CNN important point is that he met with her and not gay groups. Gives quiet support for faithful defending traditional marriage.
@CNN 😒
@CNN @Pontifex so I assume the catholic religion supports same sex marriage?
@CNN Millions of Catholics wait a Lifetime to share a moment with a Pope.Why Her?Because the Pope is a Socialist who knows Propaganda!
@CNN @DevinGoldenberg Maybe not but the Pope has a recent history of rejecting an openly gay ambassador from France to the Vatican.Says much
@CNN popeturd is back tracking already... The PC police flexing their muscle again... Disgusting; and people still worship this false idol.
@CNN @LisaToddSutton Why would he meet with her anyway? You lost me, off my list!
@CNN Simply stop talking about her
@CNN Funny how someone is inevitably going to spin it to be...
@iShakeTheThrone @Pontifex @CNN he met with a gay couple the day before Kim Davis
@CNN then he shouldn't have met with her!!
@CNN Doesn't matter why or what was said. She will put her own spin on it to further her homophobia. Just like they do with abortion issue
@CNN no it should not!
@CNN The Vatican is hedging its bets in case she goes full psycho. (She's halfway there.)
@CNN Pope met w/her in support of her religious liberty &amp; conscience to put God's law above constitution, which he made clear his position.
@CNN He too (#Pope) will stand before God. But won't be left standing. Repent of thy ways &amp; turn to God &amp; His Ways. #KimDavis -be encouraged
@CNN That is a lie and the Vatican didn't say that. Homosexual media lies like homosexuals and lesbians. #kimdavis
@CNN Pope Francis may have spoke against Jesus Christ but he is not stupid enough to take a STAND on NONSENSE by the Kentucky Clerk
@CNN then how should we consider it? A show of...???
@CNN 1)Kim Davies is1 of d most courageous human I know.ALONE,she stood PUBLICALLY to defend God's guide for Mankind's progress&amp;evolution.
@CNN that's right people! Somebody needs to tell this lady to stop judging! That's a sin! #crazylady
@CNN @Clarknt67 Read the rest of the sentence, not support for ALL of what she is doing. They qualified it. Meaning they support some of it
@Badass_Abe @CNN He is a holy man giving comfort.
@CNN I bet it was more like the pope saying whom is this obnoxious bitch and do I really have to talk to her
@SCritique @CNN the people standing against gay marriage are the minority.  46% is not a silent majority.  Less god, more math.
@CNN but what I heard on news..it seems it was a form of support..it was said that the pope told her she had rights like that which is b.s
@Badass_Abe @CNN exactly.  She should follow the Patriots mantra, ""Do your job"".
@CNN well thank God she met the Pop though it's Sad the Vatican knows what the Bible says n still don't provide support for Kim! Sad sad!"	0

1.15 million Americans have been killed by guns since John Lennon's death https://t.co/7gbHZZ0XFe https://t.co/VYACn7CPRC
@Cyrus_is_risen @RollingStone @BrianPHickey Do they use guns for that? #moron
@RollingStone @antonnewcombe surely a typo there....?
@RollingStone John -  the staggeringly stupid comments re: fetuses, President Obama, gun defense are from small #s of the disturbed.
@RollingStone Oh man...we need you and your songs today more than ever! You will be forever missed.
@RollingStone @yankeebluenose8 - About same # of abortions performed in 1980 alone. Since 1980 there have been over 23 million babies killed
@RollingStone @hEllaRedRose at least triple that number for the amount of lives lost to drunk driving since then
@Petkopova @Cinetti @RollingStone @Martina thanks we will try in london.
@RollingStone @davehydesports how many by OD?  Ban guns, they'll just smuggle them through Mexico. How many guns stopped a crime in progress
@RollingStone @CockertonMark 1.15 million? How come?
@RollingStone @davehydesports but how many have been killed by cars since then?
@RollingStone they're all nutters guns were made just to kill things it ain't good at all
@RollingStone well I assume the author meant that 1.5 million people have  been killed by other people. Cause guns  don't kill ppl, ppl do
@RollingStone @ShaunKing well this is some random shit!!!
@RollingStone @andreapetkovic No weapons that kill, it is the man that kills! Especially those who speak of peace, equality among people.
@RollingStone have you heard about our new Christmas charity single #500miles Released for download today. https://t.co/zyiCB8gtXD
@RollingStone @AskMrMickey He should've stayed in England. Poor chap!
@RollingStone @LOLGOP ONE POINT ONE FIVE MILLION!
@RollingStone Most of them in places with extreme gun control. (just keeping it fair and balanced)
@RollingStone there's some good news crime &amp; murder rates been falling for 20 years https://t.co/LEfc9Pibfs  https://t.co/UHMc6kOlN7
@RollingStone @ylisari ""Imagine all the people living life in peace...""
@RollingStone @ShaunKing so are you not A-OK with guns now?  Did you get rid of yours?
@RollingStone  that s so coooooll !;-)!
@RollingStone @davehydesports Guns do not kill anyone. Drug gangs followed by suicides make up nearly all of these deaths.
@RollingStone @LOLGOP @derek_petersen
@RollingStone @gkketch guns don't kill people on their own.
@RollingStone @davehydesports who the F cares? How many have been killed in cars?
@RollingStone @andreapetkovic You mean by fellow Americans -- not foreign terrorists, right? #NotetoTrump
@RollingStone @TheMurdochTimes Yeah man its all Lennons fault!
@RollingStone @robdowde Not so hot on animals, however- Yoko had a room full of fur coats.
@RollingStone Stop. And Imagine #JohnLennon https://t.co/7k2N0q3bxv via @amplifiedloudly
@RollingStone @ShaunKing Ultimate hipster move. Getting shot before everyone else.
@RollingStone @LOLGOP Jesus H. Christ. 1.15 million people? Who are we?
@RollingStone @davehydesports you mean killed by people. Why shift the blame?
@RollingStone He was awesome. One of the people I would to speak to, if I could.
@RollingStone @cerysmatthews Seriously? Knew it was an insane number, but that is just staggering. They're living in a war zone.
@RollingStone @SteveBertrand 60% of those numbers are suicides...
@rollingstone  song
@RollingStone Then that`s 1.15 million and 1 too many then.
@RollingStone @MayfieldJoy can you imagine how many were killed before his death

Oh my RT@cnnbrk: Attorney: New audio reveals pause in gunfire when Michael Brown was shot. http://t.co/hCRdhx8jrA
@cnnbrk SO what? Would back up that #MikeBrown may have rushed him. He tried non-lethal gunshots then had to stop the threat!
@cnnbrk image of the source http://t.co/BC4P44aRl9
@CoyJoshuacoy82 exactly!
In that pause lies the question - black or white?  @cnnbrk
@cnnbrk .... #US nid 2 face another #9/11.so dat it can respect da existance an da rytz ov others
@cnnbrk #CNN here is story. Black cop kills white man he was 2 ys older than the gentle giant, media hide race http://t.co/mftsof5AWu-Aug 20
“@cnnbrk: Attorney: New audio reveals pause in gunfire when Michael Brown was shot. http://t.co/w9jG7cul7n” when Brown was falling
“@cnnbrk: Attorney: New audio reveals pause in gunfire when Michael Brown was shot. http://t.co/PGowoHTIPi” people believe this?
@Wildchildwendy @cnnbrk if wilson had already shot him repeatedly by the time MB rushed him, wouldnt the rush be self defence?
@cnnbrk  Where did this tape come from?
@cnnbrk This sounds like a shooting in a war battle you can stop a person with 1 or 2 shots people are made the same no one is made of steel
@cnnbrk ""friend of Wilson said Brown mocked the officer and charged"" shld be ""radio station caller who claimed to be friend of Wilson's"" thx
@cnnbrk Question is if tape is authentic why wait this long to come forward?Probably his tv in the background!Smells fishy!
@cnnbrk Yeah from the shot in the car, and then in the street. How much brains does that take to understand. Let the Grand Jury decided.
@cnnbrk does anyone know how many rounds the gun could hold?
@cnnbrk @CNN -If he was running away from the cop car, why would he turned around to charge the the cop. Doesn't make sense.
@cnnbrk Thank God that the FBI is involved in this investigation so that nothing is swept under the rug.
@cnnbrk CNN the worst liberal news outlet out there. Cause that sounded so authentic....lmfao!!!!! Why didn't he come out right away.????
@cnnbrk I bet if the victim was a different race we wouldn't be talking about this.
“@cnnbrk: Attorney: New audio reveals pause in gunfire when Michael Brown was shot. http://t.co/w8CtLZVfhu” Hmm.
@cnnbrk well duh! Always a ""pause"" when i am shooting competition handgun!
@cnnbrk maybe he intentionally missed in order to get him to attempt to stop without force
6 shots - Pause - 4 shots?  “@cnnbrk: Attorney: New audio reveals pause in gunfire when Michael Brown was shot. http://t.co/9mLILkmxVh”
@cnnbrk witnesses have always described that. Catch up.
It means the officer stopped shooting                                   Then started again  @gechsor15 @JudgeReinhold @cnnbrk
@michael_epps @cnnbrk What if it was a jam? Need more data around this entire situation
“@cnnbrk: Attorney: New audio reveals pause in gunfire when Michael Brown was shot. http://t.co/N5trLHAHZm” COLD BLOODED MURDER
@cnnbrk It's taking all this time for these witnesses to come forward, how do we even know it was from the brown shooting??..
“@cnnbrk: Attorney: New audio reveals pause in gunfire when Michael Brown was shot. http://t.co/YX1htMZgSZ”#ReLoading
@cnnbrk Best to have it analyzed and verified before playing it.  And instead of giving it to police, some atty gives it to CNN??

@ksdknews @RenagadeGirl  http://t.co/CeJ8wjNJRE He would not deserve 8 bullets for a car door mishap even with a record.
And If He did does that justify his murder?? @ksdknews

@Uber_Sydney what does this mean?
@beck_sullivan The rides are free. @Uber_Sydney will be paying the drivers the increased rate out of their own pocket.
@alfinitum @Uber_Sydney Yeah I think so. They're getting $100+, riders aren't wearing diff. Good gesture. Poor message transmission
@Uber_Sydney how about paying your drivers extra to go into the cbd instead of forcing others to pay extra to travel into potential danger?
@Uber_Sydney @mtats so is uber paying for the rides paying the drivers?
@Uber_Sydney you really gotta stop the swarm model or at least have someone actually look at WHY an area is swarming.
@Uber_Sydney So are rides free or more expensive? Your tweet is very unclear
@Uber_Sydney @DrYobbo @alfinitum Faster backflip than Tony Abbott!
@Uber_Sydney @COMINT_AU when you first became aware of the situation you tweeted that prices will increase.
@Mr_Odin @Uber_Sydney What do you pay your drivers?
@Uber_Sydney reports around the world flooding in of your 400% fare increase in response to a siege situation, smart.
@Uber_Sydney hikes prices during the #sydneysiege. How is that helping? Giving away free rides would help.
@Uber_Sydney thank you for fixing this situation.
@beck_sullivan @Uber_Sydney Glad I'm not the only one who's confused ...

.@WhiteHouse in rainbow colors for #SCOTUSMarriage? Here's what I think about that decision: http://t.co/SxyILnPxmr
@Franklin_Graham @WhiteHouse "" God has consigned all men to disobedience that he may have mercy on all"" Romans 11:32
@Franklin_Graham @WhiteHouse This was not the way it should have been. The gay marriage should not have been passed. With God it won't work
@Franklin_Graham You still use Facebook after it and Mark Z support and promote #equality? http://t.co/SmuSXNf9CZ
@Franklin_Graham What has your church done to affirm their dignity, to make them feel welcome, and to make the marginalized feel loved?
@Franklin_Graham I don't think you went far ENOUGH! https://t.co/nZ2bZRtJBQ
@Franklin_Graham @WhiteHouse Ever notice how it's ok to offend Christians in the name of ""equality""?
@Franklin_Graham @WhiteHouse That's pretty gay, like @CrossFit #PrideMonth #FuckinObama #crossfit #pride
@Franklin_Graham @WhiteHouse  #StopSDN http://t.co/bbEMGWNtCd
@x__JustMe__x @Franklin_Graham @WhiteHouse well where all going to pay silent politically correct Christians have led to this
@Franklin_Graham @WhiteHouse the government is just crazy
@Franklin_Graham @WhiteHouse  Mathews 24:36-39.GODs warning of Jesus 2nd coming for those who believed like Noah. No warning for unbelievers
@Franklin_Graham And I ask the same. How is the log in your eye, Rev. Graham? @WhiteHouse
@Franklin_Graham @WhiteHouse yawn
@Franklin_Graham @WhiteHous  Who cares,
@Franklin_Graham @WhiteHouse ain't yo homophobic ass late for bingo? smh i didn't know they had fb at the nursing homes

@Franklin_Graham @WhiteHouse Praying for this country That God wd send judgment upon our leaders and save us from a Christian Holocaust
@frankwrenn @Franklin_Graham  you may have Mr Graham mixed up with Joel Olsteen.
@Franklin_Graham @WhiteHouse  Couldn't agree more! America is in trouble!!
How the fuck did every religious asshole somehow make gay marriage about them?!??  #LoveWins #LoveWon   @Franklin_Graham @WhiteHouse
@Franklin_Graham @WhiteHouse ""It shall be as in the days of Noah""
@Franklin_Graham @erotao @WhiteHouse  Amen!  God's law trumps man's law.
@allenpeacock @Franklin_Graham @WhiteHouse it's always abt them and their ""persecution"".
@Franklin_Graham Christians do not hold a trademark or copyright to the rainbow. You don't get to control how it's used. @WhiteHouse
@Franklin_Graham @jessie_hall1994 Facebook blocked at my school.  Can you summarize in 140 characters?
@Franklin_Graham @WhiteHouse I agree. Very sad.
@Franklin_Graham @WhiteHouse Amen!
@Franklin_Graham @WhiteHouse I would not even consider asking you to marry me. Don't know why would think anyone would in first place.
@Franklin_Graham How is moving your money from pro-LGBT @WellsFargo to also-pro-LGBT @askBBT working out for you?
@Franklin_Graham @WhiteHouse I thought the rainbow was a sign of God's promise? Won't be water but fire next time....
@Franklin_Graham @WhiteHouse it's is GODs rainbow that's how I see it even thou these folks use it for there belief mine is in GOD

@megynkelly Nolen deserves the death penalty. He should be laid on the chopping block and beheaded.
@megynkelly @FoxNews they need to charge the mosque where he studied this terrorism as accomplices
@megynkelly dont give him a muslim attn or juror
@megynkelly The sooner the better. He should not be breathing.

@megynkelly @FoxNews anything less will be an act of terror!
@megynkelly I'm not a huge supporter of the death penalty but if ever a case cried out for execution, this one does.

@richeisen @hunterschwarz vote barely passed. Should every Prez decorate to pander to base?
@hunterschwarz That cannot be real. Ashamed to be an American today. I want to move 2 Canada. Or Mexico. I'll take drug cartels over this.
@hunterschwarz @Lrihendry It's actually quite beautiful. just shame it is in celebration of desegregation of 3 branches of US government.
@hunterschwarz @AppSame what will it be lit up as for straight pride month? We demand equal representation.
@richeisen @hunterschwarz funny because in 2008 Biden said he and Obama were against gay marriage.. odd how no one is calling him a bigot
@hunterschwarz @BiasedGirl Isn't that special. I think I'll got out in front of my house and light up a cigar.
“@hunterschwarz: The White House is lit up rainbow. http://t.co/g1AfQPYOqX”
@hunterschwarz @Callisto1947 gay marriage is one thing; this is disgraceful to we the people that OWN that house. Mother of gay daughter
@MMM_Cubed @richeisen @hunterschwarz Dick Cheney's his dad?
@JustConservativ @richeisen @hunterschwarz  2 Timothy 1:10 (new testament)
@hunterschwarz @DeborahLovesUSA  A sad day for America! Legalizing filth !
@hunterschwarz @Callisto1947 Have nothing against gay marriage but isn't this a little much?
@hunterschwarz @mattsinger  One small step for mankind...
@hunterschwarz #stahp
@hunterschwarz @amandapalmer okay I thought it was photoshoped. Its actually rainbow? That is so cool.
@hunterschwarz Hypocritical to now celebrate something that the President was explicitly against when elected to the White House-MEDIA FAIL!
@hunterschwarz @Lrihendry that's bc you have a fruit in it
@hunterschwarz @GaetaSusan The US is now a poofter's paradise.
@hunterschwarz @redsoutrage what the fuck, I hope this isn't real
Fitting statement ""@hunterschwarz: The White House is lit up rainbow. http://t.co/sjWI2bMFgy”
@hunterschwarz @Callisto1947 Looks great!
“@hunterschwarz: The White House is lit up rainbow. http://t.co/5VmMJNZirw” Makes me sick
@winsomebulldog @MiceeMouse Maybe that would start the revolution. God know congress is revolting.
@richeisen that's wrong.
@hunterschwarz @ChristieC733  More wasted money!
@hunterschwarz @ChristieC733 Time  to take back that stolen rainbow symbol.
@hunterschwarz @DebAnker1776JAH What changes have democrats made at the WH for sodomy?
@hunterschwarz @Lrihendry No longer the ""People's "" House.  #WhiteHouse
@hunterschwarz @Callisto1947 that is a waste of money! That's the ppl house &amp; not all of us agree with this ruling or the lights!
@hunterschwarz how does the president support gays and Muslims at the same time. Maybe the Muslims should help celebrate this victory .
